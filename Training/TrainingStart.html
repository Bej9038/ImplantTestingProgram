    <h3>
        Directions: In this task, you will see a large box. After hitting the go button, the program will produce a tone that
        changes in pitch depending on your mouse's location in the box. Your goal is to find two points that create
        the most harmonic sounding line. Once you've found a point, click on the box to select the point. Once you've
        selected two points, the line you created will appear along with the actual line of harmonicity and a grade of
        how close you got to the line. To continue onto the next trial, hit the go button.
